# How to Study for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam


## Cloud Foundations

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam assumes you have some familiarity with cloud concepts. If you're completely unfamiliar with those, it may benefit you to learn or review some introductory computing concepts. When I was in college, I completed two courses that gave me a great foundation:

* [Stanford CS 101 - Introduction to Computing Principles](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/)
* [Harvard CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)
    * This course features one of my favorite professors of all time -- [David Malan](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/how-harvards-star-computer-science-professor-built-a-distance-learning-empire).

Once you're finished with these courses, you will be able to explain how computers work, how the Internet works, and you'll have a great start working with programming languages. Most importantly, you will be ready to learn how the cloud works. It's not necessary to complete these courses formally, but it would help to browse through the lessons and build up knowledge on any foreign topics.

## Guided Training

There are two cloud training platforms I will recommend for this certification: A Cloud Guru and Cloud Academy. 

* [A Cloud Guru - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 2020](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner)
    
    Designed for the non-technical crowd, this course provides 10 hours of videos, several quizzes along the way, and a final practice exam. The instructor [Ryan Kroonenburg](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/ryan-kroonenburg/) is phenomenal. I used this platform exclusively, along with the whitepapers below, and I passed my exam. [A Cloud Guru's current pricing](https://acloudguru.com/pricing) is $32/month, and it includes access to all learning paths. I've found it extremely worthwhile, and I've been fortunate to use some education reimbursement funds from my employer to cover the cost for the full year. There is also a Personal Plus plan, which I have not used, but I do see the benefit in having your own managed cloud sandbox.

* [Cloud Academy - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Preparation](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/cloud-academy-cloud-practitioner-certification-preparation-for-aws-180/)
    
    Another cloud platform out of London, this is a popular learning recommendation. I have no personal experience with this platform, but you can check out their free 7-day trial to see if you like it better than A Cloud Guru. [Their pricing is about 50% more expensive](https://cloudacademy.com/pricing/?direct=true) at $49/month.

## Whitepapers

There's nothing like good documentation. These readings are a must, and I would suggest highlighting key concepts, and making notecards for these. I've heard that AWS won't test much on specifics like pricing, but they will make sure to test understanding of why price would increase based on the service you're using.

## Flashcards

I'm passing along the flashcards that I made and used to study for this exam. It includes bits and pieces of the ACG course notes, and notes from the white papers above.

I'm interested in the [Anki Flashcard System](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), so I might export my flashcards to this platform later. But for now, Cram.com has worked fine.

## Celebrate

When you pass, you get a shiny certificate, and access to a secret AWS store where you can buy swag such as a small notebook with AWS written on it for $5 :wink:
