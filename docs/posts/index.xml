You should have hands-on experience designing end-to-end solutions, deploying VPCs that support various networking, compute, storage, and database strategies.
Background There is no better preparation than hands-on experience with AWS.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam challenges your knowledge of introductory cloud concepts. The exam does not cover any programming, any system admin types of tasks, or any advanced solution architecture designs.
