This website was designed to publish thoughts, how-to's, resources, notes, and everything in-between in the general realm of data products, but also whatever comes to mind. <i class="fas fa-database"></i>

I live in Wyandotte, Michigan with my wife, Haley, and our dog, Captain. <i class="fas fa-paw"></i>

I'm working as a Product Analyst for Disney Streaming, working within the Data Solutions & Instrumentation team to design and implement tagging across all of Disney's streaming products. <i class="fas fa-tv"></i>
