## Who am I?

* I live in Wyandotte, MI (<i>about 20 minutes south of Detroit</i>) with my wife, Haley, and our dog, Captain.
* I'm working as a Product Analyst for Disney Streaming, working within the Data Solutions & Instrumentation team to design and implement tagging across all of Disney's streaming products.
* I'm from Indiana, so basketball is in my blood. I make sure to follow NBA drama, and I watch all of Xavier's college basketball games.
* I listen to a lot of pop music. I'm a huge fan of Jack Antonoff. This is what I'm jamming to right now:

## What is this Website?

This website was designed to publish thoughts, how-to's, resources, notes, and everything in-between in the general realm of data and marketing, but also maybe basketball. Thanks for visiting!
