## Travel Map

    My wife and I founded a family travel business. I have three daughters and we like to go adventure around the world together.

    I'm learning how to be a better photographer and photo editor.

    Here are some places we've been. Click on the pins to see photos from our adventures!

    <BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading map...</div>}>
      {() => {
        const PhotoMap = require('../components/PhotoMap').default;
        return <PhotoMap locations={photoLocations} />;
      }}
    </BrowserOnly>
  </>
)}
